OERMS Frontend Design & Implementation Guide
You are building OERMS (Online Exam & Result Management System) using Next.js. Create a production-ready, user-friendly interface following these specifications:

A. Core Design Principles

Accessibility Standards:

WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
Screen reader friendly with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text

H. Brand Voice & Messaging
Tone Pillars:

Clear - No jargon, straightforward instructions
Encouraging - Positive, supportive language
Professional - Trustworthy, competent, reliable
Helpful - Proactive guidance, anticipate needs

Writing Guidelines:
Do:

Use active voice: "Submit your exam" not "Your exam should be submitted"
Be concise: "Upload failed. Try again" not "Unfortunately, there was an error..."
Use second person: "Your results" not "Student results"
Provide next steps: "Save failed. Check connection and retry."

Don't:

Use technical jargon: "Authentication failed" → "Incorrect username or password"
Be vague: "Something went wrong" → "Couldn't save your answer. We'll try again."
Blame users: "You didn't fill this" → "This field is required"
Use all caps (except buttons): "ERROR" → "Error"

Error Messages:

❌ "Error 403: Forbidden"
✅ "You don't have permission to access this. Contact your teacher."
❌ "Invalid input"
✅ "Email must include @"

Success Messages:

❌ "Operation completed successfully"
✅ "Exam submitted! You'll see results soon."
❌ "Upload successful"
✅ "OMR sheet uploaded. Processing now..."

Empty States:

❌ "No data"
✅ "No exams yet. Your teacher will assign one soon."
❌ "0 results found"
✅ "No results match your filters. Try adjusting them."

Button Labels:

Be specific: "Save Draft" not "Save"
Action-oriented: "Download PDF" not "PDF"
Short: 1-3 words maximum
